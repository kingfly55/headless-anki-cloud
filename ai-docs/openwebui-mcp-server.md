This documentation explains how to easily set up and deploy the [**MCP (Model Context Protocol)-to-OpenAPI proxy server** (mcpo)](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo) provided by Open WebUI. Learn how you can effortlessly expose MCP-based tool servers using standard, familiar OpenAPI endpoints suitable for end-users and developers.

### 📌 What is the MCP Proxy Server?[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#-what-is-the-mcp-proxy-server "Direct link to 📌 What is the MCP Proxy Server?")

The MCP-to-OpenAPI proxy server lets you use tool servers implemented with MCP (Model Context Protocol) directly via standard REST/OpenAPI APIs—no need to manage unfamiliar or complicated custom protocols. If you're an end-user or application developer, this means you can interact easily with powerful MCP-based tooling directly through familiar REST-like endpoints.

### 💡 Why Use mcpo?[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#-why-use-mcpo "Direct link to 💡 Why Use mcpo?")

While MCP tool servers are powerful and flexible, they commonly communicate via standard input/output (stdio)—often running on your local machine where they can easily access your filesystem, environment, and other native system capabilities.

That’s a strength—but also a limitation.

If you want to deploy your main interface (like Open WebUI) on the cloud, you quickly run into a problem: your cloud instance can’t speak directly to an MCP server running locally on your machine via stdio.

[That’s where mcpo comes in with a game-changing solution.](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo)

MCP servers typically rely on raw stdio communication, which is:

*   🔓 Inherently insecure across environments
*   ❌ Incompatible with most modern tools, UIs, or platforms
*   🧩 Lacking critical features like authentication, documentation, and error handling

The mcpo proxy eliminates those issues—automatically:

*   ✅ Instantly compatible with existing OpenAPI tools, SDKs, and clients
*   🛡 Wraps your tools with secure, scalable, and standards-based HTTP endpoints
*   🧠 Auto-generates interactive OpenAPI documentation for every tool, entirely config-free
*   🔌 Uses plain HTTP—no socket setup, daemon juggling, or platform-specific glue code

So even though adding mcpo might at first seem like "just one more layer"—in reality, it simplifies everything while giving you:

*   Better integration ✅
*   Better security ✅
*   Better scalability ✅
*   Happier developers & users ✅

✨ With mcpo, your local-only AI tools become cloud-ready, UI-friendly, and instantly interoperable—without changing a single line of tool server code.

### ✅ Quickstart: Running the Proxy Locally[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#-quickstart-running-the-proxy-locally "Direct link to ✅ Quickstart: Running the Proxy Locally")

Here's how simple it is to launch the MCP-to-OpenAPI proxy server using the lightweight, easy-to-use tool **mcpo** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo)):

1.   **Prerequisites**

    *   **Python 3.8+** with `pip` installed.
    *   MCP-compatible application (for example: `mcp-server-time`)
    *   (Optional but recommended) `uv` installed for faster startup and zero-config convenience.

2.   **Install mcpo**

Using **uv** (recommended):

`uvx mcpo --port 8000 -- your_mcp_server_command`

Or using `pip`:

`pip install mcpomcpo --port 8000 -- your_mcp_server_command`

1.   🚀 **Run the Proxy Server**

To start your MCP-to-OpenAPI proxy server, you need an MCP-compatible tool server. If you don't have one yet, the MCP community provides various ready-to-use MCP server implementations.

✨ **Where to find MCP Servers?**

You can discover officially supported MCP servers at the following repository example:

*   [modelcontextprotocol/servers on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

For instance, the popular **Time MCP Server** is documented [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/time/README.md), and is typically referenced clearly in the README, inside the provided MCP configuration. Specifically, the README states:

> Add to your Claude settings:
> 
> 
> 
> `"mcpServers": {     "time": {         "command": "uvx",         "args": ["mcp-server-time", "--local-timezone=America/New_York"]     } }`

🔑 **Translating this MCP setup to a quick local proxy command**:

You can easily run the recommended MCP server (`mcp-server-time`) directly through the **MCP-to-OpenAPI proxy** (`mcpo`) like this:

`uvx mcpo --port 8000 -- uvx mcp-server-time --local-timezone=America/New_York`

That's it! You're now running the MCP-to-OpenAPI Proxy locally and exposing the powerful **MCP Time Server** through standard OpenAPI endpoints accessible at:

*   📖 **Interactive OpenAPI Documentation:**[`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs)

Feel free to replace `uvx mcp-server-time --local-timezone=America/New_York` with your preferred MCP Server command from other available MCP implementations found in the official repository.

### 🚀 Accessing the Generated APIs[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#-accessing-the-generated-apis "Direct link to 🚀 Accessing the Generated APIs")

As soon as it starts, the MCP Proxy (`mcpo`) automatically:

*   Discovers MCP tools dynamically and generates REST endpoints.
*   Creates interactive, human-readable OpenAPI documentation accessible at: 
    *   `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Simply call the auto-generated API endpoints directly via HTTP clients, AI agents, or other OpenAPI tools of your preference.

### 📖 Example Workflow for End-Users[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#-example-workflow-for-end-users "Direct link to 📖 Example Workflow for End-Users")

Assuming you started the above server command (`uvx mcp-server-time`):

*   Visit your local API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
*   Select a generated endpoint (e.g. `/get_current_time`) and use the provided interactive form.
*   Click "**Execute**" and instantly receive your response.

No setup complexity—just instant REST APIs.

*   **Dynamic Schema Discovery & Endpoints:** At server startup, the proxy connects to the MCP server to query available tools. It automatically builds FastAPI endpoints based on the MCP tool schemas, creating concise and clear REST endpoints.

*   **OpenAPI Auto-documentation:** Endpoints generated are seamlessly documented and available via FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI (`/docs`). No extra doc writing required.

*   **Asynchronous & Performant**: Built on robust asynchronous libraries, ensuring speed and reliability for concurrent users.

⚡️ Why is the MCP-to-OpenAPI Proxy Superior?[​](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/#%EF%B8%8F-why-is-the-mcp-to-openapi-proxy-superior "Direct link to ⚡️ Why is the MCP-to-OpenAPI Proxy Superior?")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's why leveraging MCP servers through OpenAPI via the proxy approach is significantly better and why Open WebUI enthusiastically supports it:

*   **User-friendly & Familiar Interface**: No custom clients; just HTTP REST endpoints you already know.
*   **Instant Integration**: Immediately compatible with thousands of existing REST/OpenAPI tools, SDKs, and services.
*   **Powerful & Automatic Docs**: Built-in Swagger UI documentation is automatically generated, always accurate, and maintained.
*   **No New Protocol overhead**: Eliminates the necessity to directly handle MCP-specific protocol complexities and socket communication issues.
*   **Battle-Tested Security & Stability**: Inherits well-established HTTPS transport, standard auth methods (JWT, API keys), solid async libraries, and FastAPI’s proven robustness.
*   **Future-Proof**: MCP proxy uses existing, stable, standard REST/OpenAPI formats guaranteed long-term community support and evolution.

🌟 **Bottom line:** MCP-to-OpenAPI makes your powerful MCP-based AI tools broadly accessible through intuitive, reliable, and scalable REST endpoints. Open WebUI proudly supports and recommends this best-in-class approach.
